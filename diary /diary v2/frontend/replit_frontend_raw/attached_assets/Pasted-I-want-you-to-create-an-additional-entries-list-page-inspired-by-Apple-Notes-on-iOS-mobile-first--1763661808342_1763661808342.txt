I want you to create an additional entries list page inspired by Apple Notes on iOS – mobile-first, single column, like in the attached screenshot:


Reference image: /mnt/data/IMG_7719.PNG


This should be a separate page/screen so I can choose this layout later.
Tech & structure


Use the same stack as in this project (same framework, routing and styling approach).


Create a new page/component, for example:


NotesListView or AppleNotesStyleList




Place it in a logical folder (src/pages/ or similar) and do not modify or break existing screens.


Layout – like Apple Notes mobile
The page is a single-column list of notes, grouped by time periods, similar to Apple Notes:


Header area


Top bar with title Notes (or the diary section name).


Optional back button if needed by the existing navigation.


Below it: a search field styled like iOS:


Rounded rectangle, dark grey background.


Placeholder text like “Search”.


Minimal, calm look.






Grouped sections


Group notes into sections with headers, for example:


Today


Previous 7 Days


Previous 30 Days


Months like October, September, etc.




Section headers are simple text labels with a bit of top margin.




Note cards in the list


Each note is a rounded pill/card on a dark background, similar to Apple Notes:


Full-width minus horizontal padding.


Slightly lighter than the page background.


Soft shadow or subtle glow to feel “cushiony” but not too flashy.




Inside each card:


Title – first line of the entry (bold).


Secondary line – time + short snippet, or “No additional text”.


For example: 14:41  No additional text.






Truncate long titles/snippets with ellipsis.


On tap/press:


Provide a visual feedback (slight scale, brighter background).


Navigate to the existing entry detail screen if one already exists, or to a placeholder detail page for now.






Bottom spacing


Add safe-area padding at the bottom so the last cards are not hidden behind the system bar.




Insights controls (Weekly / Monthly / Yearly)
I also need insights buttons on this page:


Place a small, elegant control near the top of the list, under the main Notes title but above the first section.


Create a segmented control or 3 pill buttons:


Weekly


Monthly


Yearly




Style:


Small, rounded pills.


Calm, minimal outlines or filled state for the active one.




Behavior:


Clicking a pill changes the selected insight mode in state:


selectedInsight = 'weekly' | 'monthly' | 'yearly'.




Under the pills, show a simple placeholder block such as:


“Weekly insight: coming soon…”


“Monthly insight: most common tags, mood summary…”


“Yearly insight: big-picture trends…”




This insight block should be a soft, rounded panel that fits our dreamy, meditative style.




Style & mood


Dark theme with a soft gradient background (e.g. deep navy → muted purple), very subtle and not distracting.


Minimal, clean, calm.


Rounded corners and soft shadows for cards.


Text color: off-white, easy on the eyes (not pure white).


Animations should be gentle and slow if you add them.


Navigation


Expose this page via a clear route or export:


For example, add a route like /notes-list (if the app uses a router) or export the component so I can wire it into navigation later.




Keep all other screens unchanged; this is an alternative notes/entries index view.


Please generate the full code for this new page (component + styles + basic state for section grouping and insight selection) so I can drop it into my project as a separate screen.
