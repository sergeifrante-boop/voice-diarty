Right now I already have a calendar-style entries view.
I want you to create an additional layout inspired by Apple Notes – as a separate page/screen that I can later choose between.

Tech & structure

Use the same stack as in this project (same framework and styling approach).

Create a new page/component, for example:

AppleNotesLayout (or NotesSplitView)

put it in a logical place like src/pages/ or src/components/pages/.

Do not break or remove any existing pages – this is an alternative view.

General idea

The screen should work similar to Apple Notes on macOS:

Left column (sidebar) – list of entries grouped by date/month.

Right column – full view of the selected entry.

The whole page should stay in the same style as the rest of my app:
soft, slightly dreamy, minimal, calm, not noisy.

Layout details

1. Overall layout

Two-column split view:

Left sidebar: about 25–30% width on desktop, slide-in panel on mobile.

Right pane: 70–75% width, main reading area.

Use a full-height layout with subtle padding and rounded corners on cards where appropriate.

2. Left sidebar – months and entries

Make it visually reminiscent of Apple Notes, but in my style:

Background: dark, slightly translucent panel over a subtle gradient.

Group entries by date/month:

Section headers like: “Today”, “September 2025”, “April 2025”, “2024”, “2023” etc.

For each entry in the list:

Show time (e.g. 14:41).

Show first line as the title (bold).

Optional small secondary line: “No additional text” or a short snippet.

On hover/active:

Slight glow or soft highlight (not too aggressive).

Selected entry is clearly highlighted (e.g. pill/rounded rectangle, slightly brighter background).

Add a very subtle divider between year groups.

3. Right pane – selected entry

Show the selected entry in a clean “diary page” style:

At the top: date and time (e.g. 20 November 2025 at 14:41) in smaller, calmer text.

Below: the diary text, large and easy to read, with generous line height.

Keep the background dark but slightly lighter than the global background, like a reading surface.

Typography:

Bigger font size for the text (comfortable reading).

Slightly warm white color, not pure #FFFFFF, to be easier on the eyes.

The text block should feel like a page: good margins, subtle rounded corners if it’s in a card.

Insights controls (Monthly / Weekly / Yearly)

I also want insights buttons on this page:

At the top of the right pane (above the entry text or in a top toolbar), add three pill-style buttons or a segmented control:

Weekly insight

Monthly insight

Yearly insight

Style:

Small, soft pills with rounded corners.

Calm hover/active states (slight glow or subtle inner shadow).

Behavior:

For now, it’s enough if clicking each button shows a placeholder area under the header or a side panel with dummy content such as:

“Weekly insight: coming soon…”

“Monthly insight: most common tags, mood summary, word count…”

“Yearly insight: big-picture trends…”

Implement this with simple state, e.g. selectedInsight = 'weekly' | 'monthly' | 'yearly'.

Style & mood

Overall vibe:

Meditative, dreamy, cozy, not corporate.

Dark theme with soft gradients (e.g. deep navy → muted purple) and very subtle motion if you want (tiny floating particle background is ok).

No hard edges: use rounded corners, soft shadows, and smooth transitions.

Keep everything clean and minimal, avoid clutter.

Navigation

Expose this page in a way that I can easily navigate to it:

For example, add a route /notes-split (if using a router) or export the component clearly so I can wire it later.

If you adjust routing, don’t change the existing calendar screen logic – just add this new variant.

Finally, please generate the full code for this page (component, styles, and any necessary minimal state logic) so I can copy it as a standalone screen into my project.
