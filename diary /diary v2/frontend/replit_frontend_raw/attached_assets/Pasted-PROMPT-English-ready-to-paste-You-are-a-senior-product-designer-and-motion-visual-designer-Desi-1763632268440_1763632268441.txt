PROMPT (English, ready to paste)

You are a senior product designer and motion/visual designer.
Design the UI and visual language for a mobile app called “Inner Journal” (working title).
The app is a voice-based personal journal that uses AI to transcribe entries, extract themes, and gently reflect insights back to the user.

The design must feel:

Calm, soft, minimal, “dreamy”

Slightly meditative and introspective

Warm and human, not clinical, not techy

Appealing for a core audience between 15–40 years old

Think of it as a mix of:

a mindful meditation app,

a private notebook,

and a soft “AI mirror” for your inner life.

1. Global visual language

Color palette

Overall light theme.

Background: very soft off-white with a subtle warm tint (e.g. “morning fog”).

Accents: muted, dreamy tones: dusty rose, soft lavender, pale warm beige, muted blue.

No harsh pure blacks. Use very dark warm gray for text.

Use subtle vertical or radial gradients in some screens, but keep them very low contrast and “foggy”, almost like a distant haze.

Optionally add a barely visible grain/noise texture on large backgrounds to avoid flatness.

Typography

Use clean, modern, highly readable sans serif fonts that still feel warm:

Primary heading font (titles): Space Grotesk or DM Sans (semi-bold for section titles, medium for UI labels).

Body text font: Manrope or Inter (regular for paragraphs, medium for important text).

Avoid serif or handwriting fonts – the “journal” feeling should come from layout and spacing, not from cliché handwriting fonts.

Typography style:

Generous line spacing.

Medium-sized headings, not huge; everything should feel quiet.

Use sentence-case, not ALL CAPS.

Shapes and components

Use soft rounded rectangles and pills (border radius 16–24).

No sharp corners, no strong neumorphism. Shadows are soft and subtle.

Primary interactive elements should feel tactile and cushioned, like soft pills or orbs, but still minimal.

Icons: minimal stroke icons, thin, almost monochrome. Avoid explicit “microphone” icons for the main action.

Motion principles

Motion is slow, smooth, easing – like breathing.

Use gentle parallax and micro-movement in background elements to create a dreamy feeling without distracting.

Avoid flashy animations. Think of slow drifting and subtle pulsing.

2. Screen 1 – Home / Recording Screen

Goal: One main action – press to record a voice journal entry.

Concept:

The entire screen is dedicated to a single central recording button, with supporting subtle visuals.

No microphone icon on this button. The fact that it’s the only big element in the center should make it obvious that you tap it to “speak your mind”.

Layout:

Top: small, simple text like “Today’s entry” or “When you’re ready, just start talking”.

Center: a large, soft, slightly 3D orb or pill-shaped button:

Slight internal gradient that makes it look softly inflated / tactile.

On idle: very subtle “breathing” animation: slow scale in/out by 2–3%.

Instead of a mic icon, show gentle waveform/ripple lines across the surface or just under it, slightly animated (like waves waiting for your voice).

Background:

Light, dreamy gradient (e.g. warm beige to soft lavender) with very subtle moving blobs/clouds.

Slow, barely noticeable motion, as if the background is “breathing” with you.

States:

Idle: button calm, background slowly drifting.

Recording: button glows slightly stronger, ripple/wave animation reacts subtly to audio level.
Change top text to something like: “Speak freely. We’ll remember this for you.”

Processing: after user taps to stop:

Button shows a soft loading state (rotating halo, or tiny dots circling the edge).

A small caption: “Turning your words into a page…”

This screen should immediately convey: calm, safe, private space to speak.

3. Screen 2 – Entry Detail (after transcription)

This screen appears right after the AI finishes transcribing and analyzing the voice entry.

Concept:

The user sees their spoken words transformed into a gentle, well-formatted journal fragment.

It should look like a clean “page” inside a minimalist notebook.

Layout:

Background: same calm base as Home, maybe slightly more neutral (less movement).

At the top:

Small date: “May 15, 2024” (light gray).

Title generated by AI, styled like a journal title (e.g. “A Quiet Morning Reflection”), using the heading font, medium/large, left-aligned, with lots of white space around it.

Under the title: a horizontal row of tags as soft pills:

Example: Work · Doubt · Self-Compassion

Pills have very light backgrounds and thin borders.

Main block: the transcript as a paragraph:

Use generous margins and line height.

Maybe indent the first line slightly to feel like a written paragraph.

Optionally, emphasize some phrases by slightly darker text if they are important.

Below transcript: a small section “Reflections” or “Noticed for you”:

A faint horizontal divider.

2–3 bullet points with short, gentle observations from AI.

Example style:

“You seemed very tired about your work today.”

“You often mention the need for rest and recognition.”

Tone: supportive, non-judgmental.

Hierarchy:

Title and date → tags → main text → insights.

This page must feel like opening a beautiful, quiet page of a digital diary, not like reading a chatbot reply.

4. Screen 3 – Calendar View

Goal:

Let users browse their entries by date.

Show tags next to each entry so you can see your emotional / thematic history at a glance.

Layout:

Top area: month selector (◀ May 2024 ▶) centered and minimal.

Main area divided into two vertical sections:

Calendar grid at the top.

Daily entries list at the bottom.

Calendar grid:

Minimalist month grid with small, soft circles for days that have entries.

Today might have a slightly stronger ring.

When a day is selected:

The date cell gets a soft highlight (pill background).

Daily entry list (for selected day):

Appears just below or slides up from bottom.

For each entry on that day:

Show time (21:34), short title, and inline tags.

Format example:
21:34 — Doubts about work
Tags: work • self-criticism • tiredness

Keep it very clean: no thumbnails, no heavy cards. Just soft dividers and plenty of space.

Visual style:

Calendar should still feel part of the “meditative” world:

Slight gradient behind the grid,

Soft highlight on selected day,

Maybe tiny, slow-floating dots in the background to hint at days as “points in time”.

This screen should give the feeling:
“I’m looking at the landscape of my days and moods, not at a rigid productivity calendar.”

5. Screen 4 – Tag Cloud (Dreamy 3D Space)

Goal:

A dreamy, animated cloud of tags representing topics/emotions across the user’s entries.

You can navigate this almost like a calm 3D space.

Concept:

Imagine a softly lit 3D universe of floating words.

Each tag is a word (e.g. work, family, anxiety, gratitude) floating in space.

The more frequent the tag, the larger and slightly closer it appears.

Visual and motion:

Background: deep but soft gradient (e.g. from warm dark navy to muted purple), with tiny, subtle particles drifting.

Tags:

Rendered as white/very light text with a faint glow or pill outline.

Vary size based on weight/frequency.

Move slowly and gently, like they’re drifting in water or space.

When user drags/swipes, the whole cloud rotates slightly in 3D (parallax layers).

On hover/tap:

The selected tag slowly moves towards the center and becomes sharper.

Around it, related tags cluster slightly closer.

Interaction:

Tapping a tag:

Shows a small overlay or bottom sheet:

Short explanation: “You mentioned this 12 times in the last month.”

Button: “View entries with this tag” → navigates to a filtered list/journal view.

There should be a sense of exploration: you’re moving through your own emotional universe.

Overall:

This screen is the most “dreamy” and animated, but still slow and gentle, never chaotic.

6. Tone & Messaging

Microcopy throughout the app must be:

Gentle, non-judgmental, supportive.

Short and simple.

Avoid clinical language, diagnoses, or “productivity hustle” language.

Examples of microcopy:

On home: “Whenever you’re ready, just talk.”

While processing: “We’re turning your thoughts into a page.”

On empty states: “No entries yet. Your first words can be a simple ‘Today I feel…’.”

7. Deliverables / Expectations

Please provide:

A coherent design system (colors, typography, button styles, card styles).

High-fidelity UI mockups (or very detailed wireframes) for:

Home / Recording screen (with idle, recording, processing states).

Entry Detail screen (after transcription).

Calendar view with entries and tags.

Tag Cloud view with 3D-like drifting tags.

Notes on motion/animation:

How the background breathes.

How the central button pulses.

How the tag cloud moves and responds to user gestures.

The final result should feel like a soft, private, meditative companion that helps people see their needs and understand themselves better, while still being modern and attractive for users aged roughly 15–40.
